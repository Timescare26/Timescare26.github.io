How to Improve Focus During Your Studying Process with Proven Techniques

Most students have trouble focusing on their studies. Other people, social networking, background noise and even our own thoughts can easily get in the way of concentrating on the task at hand. Take heart; concentration is not something you were born with; it is a skill that can be developed through simple habit changes that become part of your daily routine.

1. Identify A Fixed Study Time

Your brain is most successful when it is on a calendar-based schedule. Choose a single time during the day to study — for instance, every day between 6pm-8pm. By setting the same time aside for studying, your brain will automatically know it is time to be in a state of concentration.

2. Limit Distractions In Your Environment

While studying, turn off your phone (or leave it somewhere far away from you), close any unnecessary web pages and put only what you need, whether physical or mental, on your table or desk. A clean, distraction-free environment will help increase how long you can concentrate.

3. Utilize The Pomodoro Technique (Use The 25-Minute Rule)

Instead of studying for long periods of time at once, use these methods as a way of breaking up your study time into smaller time frames through this method:

25 minutes of full concentration studying

5-minute short break

Repeat for four times and take a longer break.

This method prevents mental fatigue and will help keep you focused and allow you to stay focused for longer periods of time during the entire session.

4.Set Smaller Daily Goals; Not Just Large Ones</p>
